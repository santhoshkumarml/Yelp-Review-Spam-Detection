# Review Spam Detection in Yelp.com by Spotting Temporal Anomalies Of Network Graphs
 We predict fake reviews in on­line businesses using enhanced LOOPY BELIEF PROPAGATION of Markov Networks on large networked graphs based on an algorithm that is scalable and fast.
Classification of the subjects: (a) fake reviewers (b) bad/inferior products (c) fake reviews 
We extended a version of the Loopy Belief Propagation method called SIA(Signed Inference Algorithm) introduced in [“Opinion Fraud Detection in Online Reviews by Network Effects”, 2013, Leman Akoglu, Rishi Chandy, Christos Faloustsos] (https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewFile/5981/6338) to include temporal anomaly detection.
